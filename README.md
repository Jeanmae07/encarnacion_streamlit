The ass.py code creates a basic web application using Streamlit that collects user information through a form. It asks for the user's full name, email, phone number, age, and a 4-digit PIN, then displays the entered data after submission while masking the PIN for privacy. The app provides a simple and interactive way to gather data securely from users.


The ass1.py code builds a Streamlit web app that allows users to upload a CSV file, view the data, apply filters, and generate a histogram based on numerical columns. Users can select filter values from the sidebar, view the filtered data, and download it as a CSV file. The app is useful for quick data exploration and visualization without needing to write code manually.


The ass2.py contains Streamlit app to serves as an interactive learning tool for exploring key topics in Data Warehousing and Enterprise Data Management (EDM). Users can select a topic from the sidebar to view explanations, including ETL processes, data integration, governance, modeling, and more. It also includes educational tabs, a checklist for setting up a data warehouse, and links to helpful resources.


The ass3.py contains COVID-19 dashboard that displays recent data for selected countries using the Disease.sh API. It shows daily statistics for the past 30 days, including new cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases, along with visualizations like line and pie charts. Users can choose a country from the sidebar, view key metrics and trends, and optionally display the raw data table. The app also calculates the ratio of recovered to death cases to provide additional insight into the country's COVID-19 situation.


The ass4.py contains a Streamlit application to connects to a MySQL database named `hospital` and provides a dashboard for managing doctor and patient records. Users authenticate via a sidebar login form, and upon successful login, they can view, filter, and insert records into the selected table. The app employs SQLAlchemy for database interactions and utilizes `st.cache_resource` to optimize database connections.


The ass5.py code creates a Streamlit app that displays live video from your webcam, allowing users to apply various filters like brightness, contrast, grayscale, Canny edge detection, blur, and sepia. Users can take snapshots of the video, which are saved with a timestamp, and stop the video feed when desired. The app uses OpenCV for video processing and manipulation.


The series of screenshots from ass.py, ass1, ass2, ass3, ass4, and ass5 illustrate the step-by-step execution and results of the code.
